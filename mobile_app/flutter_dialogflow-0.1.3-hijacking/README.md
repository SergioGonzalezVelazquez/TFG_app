### Dialogflow v2
* Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) register and create new Agent

    * From the GCP console, go to APIs and Services and click on credentials. 
    * Click on Create credentials and choose Service account key.
    * Select your service account from the dropdown, choose JSON and click Create. This will download the JSON key to your computer. Save it securely.
    * We downloaded a JSON file with all our data.
* In your project create folder assets(folder name recommended optional)
* Move file json in your project in folder created
* open file pubspec.yaml
```
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - assets/your_file_downloaded_google_cloud.json
```
* Import dialogflow_v2

  AuthGoogle authGoogle = await AuthGoogle(fileJson: "Asset Your File Json").build();
  // Select Language.ENGLISH or Language.SPANISH or others...
  Dialogflow dialogflow =Dialogflow(authGoogle: authGoogle,language: Language.ENGLISH); 
  AIResponse response = await dialogflow.detectIntent("Your Query");
```

  Dialogflow dialogflow = Dialogflow(authGoogle: authGoogle,language: Language.ENGLISH);
  AIResponse response = await dialogflow.detectIntent("Hi!!!");
  print(response.getMessage())
